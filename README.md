## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Used **OpenCV** and **NumPy** to preprocess medical images (resizing, normalization).
- Applied data augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, scaling) to increase dataset diversity and reduce overfitting.

### 2. Model Training
- Fine-tuned pre-trained CNN models (**DenseNet201**, **InceptionV3**, **MobileNetV2**, **ResNet50**, **VGG19**) using **TensorFlow** and **Transfer Learning**.
- Trained models with various optimizers (Adam, SGD, RMSprop) and learning rates (0.1, 0.01, 0.001).

### 3. Hyperparameter Optimization
- Employed **Grid Search** (via Scikit-learn) to tune:
  - Learning rates: 0.1, 0.01, 0.001
  - Batch sizes
  - Optimizers: Adam, SGD, RMSprop
- Resulted in a **20% performance improvement**.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated models on multiple metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - Cohen‚Äôs Kappa (inter-rater agreement)
  - Jaccard Index (similarity between predicted and true labels)
- Computed average metrics across 9 configurations per model (3 optimizers √ó 3 learning rates).
